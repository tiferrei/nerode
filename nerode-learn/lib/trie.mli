(** A map from prefix closed sets of Words. The operations that fill in values
    of the map do so with a [query] callback function of type [word -> 'a]. (The
    essential example of this is the teacher's membership query, in which case
    ['a] is likely to be [bool] or [bool option]. The functions that include
    [extend] in the name add a leaf for each symbol in the alphabet beyond the
    given word. *)
